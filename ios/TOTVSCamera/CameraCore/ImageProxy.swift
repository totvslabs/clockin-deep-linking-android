        Failure to close the proxy after use might lead to not receiving more images.

        Since this is a proxy around an image, is possible that over time
        we wrap here another representation of image, hence this might return null
        under those conditions.
     
        Notice that [image] must not be closed by the caller, instead close this proxy.
