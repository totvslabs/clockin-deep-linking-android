        Since this is a proxy around an image, is possible that over time
        we wrap here another representation of image, hence this might return null
        under those conditions.
     
        We recommend to use [buffer] for analysis instead, since accesing the underlying CGImage
        requires a creation of such image from the buffer. It might be more optimized to use
        the buffer directly.
