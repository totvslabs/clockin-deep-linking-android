        This method don't save the captured image but instead hand the image as a proxy
        to the caller.
    
        IMPORTANT: the caller must close the captured image after using it, otherwise
        no more images might be taken and handled down to the caller. This behavior
        is implementation dependent, but is mandatory to close the captured image.
