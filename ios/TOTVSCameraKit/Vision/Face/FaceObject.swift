/**
* Vision object that represents a detected barcode.
*
* Encoded information on this object, depends on the kind of detector used.
*
* While designing this class we took the decision to leave [landmarks] as a data class
* param even though is not meant to be accessible to the exterior, because we want automatic
* consideration of it on copy, equals and hashCode generated code. This can lead to some
* interesting consequences, like the following:
* 1. The field is private to the caller but modifiable by the class itself
* 2. The caller have the power to freeze the list of landmarks. In this case, any attempt
* to modify the landmarks won't have any effect.
