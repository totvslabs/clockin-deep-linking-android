/**
* Immutable detection analyzer that keep a registry of [VisionDetector]. By default detectors
* are enabled until they're manually disabled.
*
* This analyzer models a set of detectors that have the potential to be all enabled at the
* same time or only some of them.
*
* An enabled detector is one for which on every run of [analyze] it executes it detection
* procedure.
*
* [VisionDetector] can be enabled and disabled at any time through [enable] and [disable]
* methods. These operations do nothing if the requested [VisionDetector] doesn't exists
* in this [DetectionAnalyzer].
*
* This analyzer post individual detection tasks on [executor] which means that if the
* executor can ony run less than the number of detectors passed to this analyzer, the
* executor will halt until previous detection finishes. It's highly recommended that the
* executor capacity is at least as the number of detectors passed to this analyzer.
*
* This analyzer closes the [ImageProxy] after all the detectors are done with it.
*
* Contract [VisionDetector] on this analyzer must meet:
*
* 1. By nature this analyzer expect the detectors to emit only one detection, thus is a
* requirement on the detector to identify the appropriate measure to detect the most
* prominent detection and report it. The behavior is undefined if multiple detections
* are emitted by a single detection phase.
*
* For cases in which multiple emission are allowed from the detectors on a single phase
* one can subclass this analyzer and override [analyze] then the detectors can post
* a kind of [VisionObject] that pack multiple results and having the new analyzer
* coordinate the detectors emissions.
*
* 2. [VisionDetector] on this analyzer are required to call [onDetected] callback so the
* analyzer trigger that they are done performing their work. If this is not performed
* this analyzer will lock until the [executor] then is shut down.
