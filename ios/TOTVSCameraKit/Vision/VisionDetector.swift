/**
* Interface for detectors. The nature of a detectors can be of _Single emission_ or
* _Multiple emission_ during it detection phase.
*
* A _Single emission_ [VisionDetector] tries to detect the entities in an [ImageProxy]
* and then take the most prominent detection and report it as the suited on while a
* _Multiple emission_ [VisionDetector] reports all the detected entities.
*
* Most if not all the detectors in this library are _Single emission_ detectors.
* Each detector have a prominent selection strategy that determines how the detector
* select it's most prominent detection.
*
* Contract that every detector must meet
*
* 1. Is prohibited to a [VisionDetector] to close the [ImageProxy] it works on. It's a responsibility
* of an [ImageAnalyzer] to close such images, since the nature of some analyzer might be an
* aggregation of multiple detectors.
*
* 2. [VisionDetector]'s are advised to use [exclusiveUse] extension method on [ImageProxy]
* to consume the image they receive and use it to construct the representation of the
* data they will ultimately use for detection.
